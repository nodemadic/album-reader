Building the Web App

1. Set up a React project using create-react-app.

2. Install the Material-UI library and use it to create a user interface that allows users to upload an image.

3. Use TensorFlow.js to run a pre-trained machine learning model on the uploaded image and identify the vinyl record.

4. Build an API client that can make requests to the Discogs API and return information about the vinyl record.

5. Use the API client to display information about the vinyl record on the user interface.

6. Test the web application and make any necessary changes.


Converting it to a Mobile App

1. Set up a new React Native project.

2. Copy over the code from the web application, making any necessary changes to account for differences in the React Native environment.

3. Test the mobile app on both iOS and Android devices.

4. Make any necessary changes to ensure the app runs smoothly on both platforms.

5. Submit the app to the App Store and Google Play for distribution.
